# Architecture Comparison: Your Implementation vs Journal

## Overview

This document compares the architecture implemented in this project with the architecture described in the referenced journal for the thesis titled "OPTIMALISASI KINERJA DASHBOARD MONITORING UNTUK PENGOLAHAN DATA LOG BERSKALA BESAR".

## Architecture Diagrams

### Your Architecture
```
web-server -> fluentbit -> kafka -> flink -> clickhouse -> grafana
```

### Journal Architecture
```
web server -> Nginx -> Flume -> Kafka -> Flink -> Apache Doris -> Grafana
```

## Component-by-Component Comparison

### 1. Data Collection Layer

| Aspect | Your Implementation | Journal Implementation | Comparison |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Components** | web-server -> fluentbit | web server -> Nginx -> Flume | Your implementation is more streamlined with one fewer component |
| **Log Collection** | Fluent Bit | Flume | Fluent Bit is generally more lightweight and has lower resource requirements than Flume |
| **Performance** | Optimized for high-throughput | Multiple components may introduce latency | Needs benchmarking |
| **Configuration Complexity** | Simpler with fewer components | More complex with additional Nginx layer | Your implementation may be easier to maintain |

### 2. Message Broker

| Aspect | Your Implementation | Journal Implementation | Comparison |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Technology** | Kafka | Kafka | Identical |
| **Configuration** | Custom configuration | Not specified | Needs comparison |
| **Integration** | Direct integration with Fluent Bit | Integration with Flume | Similar complexity |

### 3. Stream Processing

| Aspect | Your Implementation | Journal Implementation | Comparison |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Technology** | Flink | Flink | Identical |
| **Implementation** | Python-based (as seen in flink/flink_with_python) | Not specified | Need journal details for comparison |
| **Processing Logic** | Custom implementation | Not specified | Need journal details for comparison |

### 4. Data Storage

| Aspect | Your Implementation | Journal Implementation | Comparison |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Database** | ClickHouse | Apache Doris | Different technologies |
| **Query Performance** | ClickHouse is known for fast analytical queries | Apache Doris is a distributed OLAP database | Needs benchmarking |
| **Storage Efficiency** | ClickHouse uses column-oriented storage | Apache Doris uses column-oriented storage | Similar, but implementation details may differ |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable | Highly scalable | Similar |

### 5. Visualization

| Aspect | Your Implementation | Journal Implementation | Comparison |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Technology** | Grafana | Grafana | Identical |
| **Dashboards** | Custom dashboards | Not specified | Need journal details for comparison |
| **Data Source Integration** | ClickHouse | Apache Doris | Different, may affect query performance |

## Comparison Methodology

### Performance Metrics to Compare

1. **Data Throughput**
   - Log ingestion rate (events/second)
   - Maximum sustainable throughput

2. **Latency**
   - End-to-end latency (from log generation to dashboard visualization)
   - Component-specific latency (collection, processing, storage)

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - CPU usage
   - Memory consumption
   - Disk I/O
   - Network I/O

4. **Query Performance**
   - Query response time for common dashboard operations
   - Query response time under load

5. **Scalability**
   - Performance under increasing log volumes
   - Horizontal scaling capabilities

### Recommended Benchmarking Tests

1. **Steady-State Performance**
   - Constant rate log ingestion over extended periods

2. **Burst Handling**
   - Sudden spikes in log volume

3. **Recovery Testing**
   - System recovery after component failures

4. **Query Performance**
   - Dashboard rendering time with increasing data volume
   - Complex query performance

## Next Steps for Comparison

1. Implement standardized benchmark tests across both architectures
2. Collect detailed metrics using Prometheus and existing monitoring
3. Document performance differences under various load conditions
4. Analyze trade-offs between architectural choices
5. Provide optimization recommendations based on findings

## Conclusion

The key architectural differences lie in the data collection layer (Fluent Bit vs. Flume) and the storage layer (ClickHouse vs. Apache Doris). These differences may have significant implications for performance, scalability, and maintenance complexity that can be quantified through systematic benchmarking.
